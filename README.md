# Dynamic Solar System Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is a single-page, dynamic portfolio website designed with a space/solar system theme. The concept uses visual metaphors where each "planet" represents a different section of your portfolio (such as Skills, Projects, Contact, etc.). The navigation is carried out by a small satellite that travels automatically from one planet to another when the user interacts with the interface. As the satellite reaches a planet, the planet and its contents enlarge to reveal more detailed information. The education and experience section is uniquely represented by a planet with multiple moons serving as timeline markers.

## Features
- **Dynamic Navigation:** Transition between planets via an animated, automatically moving satellite.
- **Interactive Elements:** Planets enlarge on selection to display detailed content.
- **Unique Timeline Representation:** The education/experience section is shown as a planet with moons indicating milestones.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
- **Clean and Minimal Aesthetic:** Focus on a modern, minimalistic design that balances creativity with usability.

## Technologies
To create this interactive and visually appealing website, the following technologies are suggested:

### Front-End
- **React.js:**  
  A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture. Perfect for managing the state and dynamic content of a single-page application.

- **Three.js:**  
  A powerful library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. Ideal for creating and animating the solar system elements (planets, satellite, moons).

- **HTML5 & CSS3:**  
  Standard web technologies to lay out your content and ensure the site is responsive. CSS3 animations and transitions can be used to complement the Three.js animations.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):**  
  This library is an excellent addition for controlling animations with precision. It can be used in conjunction with Three.js to manage more complex and smooth animations.

### Back-End (Optional)
- **Node.js with Express:**  
  If you need a server for handling form submissions or additional API functionality, Node.js with the Express framework is a lightweight and effective choice.

- **Firebase or a similar BaaS:**  
  For simpler setups that require data storage or real-time interactions (e.g., contact form submissions), a Backend-as-a-Service solution can reduce backend complexity.
